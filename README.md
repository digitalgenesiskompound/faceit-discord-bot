- **üí¨ Match Threads** - Creates dedicated Discord threads for each match with RSVP buttons
- **üîó Account Linking** - One-click registration system to link Discord ‚Üî FACEIT accounts
- **üìä Match Tracking** - View upcoming/finished matches and player statistics
- **üîß Admin Tools** - Backup system, cache management, and user administration
- **üê≥ Docker Ready** - Easy deployment with automatic restarts and health monitoring

## Commands

**For Everyone:**
- `/help` - Show all available commands
- `/matches` - View upcoming matches
- `/register` - Link your Discord to FACEIT (one-click)
- `/profile` - View your linked FACEIT profile
- `/lookup <player>` - Search FACEIT players
- `/finishedmatches` - View recent match results

**Admin Only:**
- `/backup-create` - Manual database backup
- `/clear-cache` - Clear bot caches
- `/clean-rsvp-status` - Reset RSVP data

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Required IDs and Tokens

**FACEIT API:**
- Get API key from [FACEIT Developer Portal](https://developers.faceit.com/)
- Find your team ID from your FACEIT team page URL: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Discord Bot:**
- Create bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Copy bot token and bot client ID
- Invite bot to server with "All Chat" permissions
- Copy channel ID where you want notifications (enable Developer Mode in Discord)
- Copy your Discord user ID (for admin commands)

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# FACEIT
FACEIT_API_KEY=your_faceit_api_key_here
TEAM_ID=your_faceit_team_id_here

# Discord
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id_here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id_here
ADMIN_DISCORD_ID=your_discord_user_id_here

# Optional (for faster command deployment)
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id_here
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/faceit-discord-bot.git
cd faceit-discord-bot
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify

- Bot should be online in Discord
- Test with `/help` command
- Check health: `http://localhost:8080/health`

## Management

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f bot

# Restart bot
docker compose restart bot

# Update and rebuild
git pull && docker compose up -d --build

# Manual backup
cp ./data/bot.db ./data/bot.db.backup
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting
1. Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs bot`
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure Discord bot token is valid
4. Check FACEIT API key permissions

### Commands Not Working
1. Verify bot has necessary Discord permissions
2. Check if slash commands are registered: look for registration messages in logs
3. For guild-specific commands, ensure `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is correct
4. Global commands can take up to 1 hour to propagate

### No Match Notifications
1. Verify `TEAM_ID` is correct (UUID format)
2. Check `FACEIT_API_KEY` has access to team data
3. Ensure `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` is valid
4. Check scheduled task logs (every 30 minutes)

### Database Issues
1. Check `./data` directory permissions
2. Verify SQLite database file exists: `./data/bot.db`
3. Container runs as `node` user - ensure proper file ownership

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor API rate limits in logs
2. Check memory usage: `docker stats faceit-discord-bot`
3. Review cache performance in application logs

## How It Works

- **Match Detection**: Checks FACEIT API every 30 minutes for new team matches
- **Thread Creation**: Creates Discord threads with RSVP buttons for each match
- **Account Linking**: Players use `/register` to link Discord ‚Üî FACEIT accounts
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database persists user links and RSVP data
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups every 6 hours + manual backup commands
